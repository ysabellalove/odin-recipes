# odin-recipes

This is the first project for The Odin Project where I will
be creating a basic recipe website! It should reinforce the
HTML lessons I've been learning and later we'll make it 
actually look pretty with CSS. Right now it's about making
it function and be organized (correct file folders and the like).
This will also be the first project I'll be legitimately posting
to GitHub for public consumption, so that also means I'll be
brushing up on my Git Basics so hopefully that becomes second
nature.
