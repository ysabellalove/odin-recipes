        <h2>Description</h2>
        This Earl Grey tiramisu is a delicious twist on tiramisu, a classic fancy dessert!
        Instead of coffee or espresso, the ladyfingers are soaked in flavorful and 
        aromatic vanilla Earl Grey tea. The soaked ladyfingers are then layered with
        vanilla mascarpone whipped cream. It's also a "no bake" recipe! Instead, you
        chill the dessert in the refrigerator. Overnight, the ladyfingers soften and
        absorb everything, turning into an airy, creamy, cloud-like, tea-flavoured 
        bowl dessert!

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>First, make the Earl Grey tea concentrate.</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Bring the water to a boil in a heavy-bottomed, medium saucepan
                            over high heat. Add the Earl Grey tea and immediately reduce
                            the heat to medium-low. Simmer for 10 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Place the sugar for the tea concentrate in a medium,
                            heatproof bowl.
                        </li>
                        <li>After 10 minutes, taste the concentrate. It should be
                            incredibly strong, almost bitter. If it's not quite there,
                            simmer for another 5 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>When the concentrate is ready, place a fine-mesh sieve over
                            the bowl with the sugar and strain the concentrate into the bowl.
                            Gently press on the tea leaves or bags with a heatproof spatula
                            and discard them. Whisk the concentrate to dissolve the sugar,
                            then whisk in the vanilla and salt.
                        </li>
                        <li>Set on a wire rack to cool slightly while you make the
                            mascarpone whipped cream.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Make the mascarpone whipped cream.</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Whisk the cream on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about
                            1 to 2 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add the mascarpone and vanilla for the whipped cream all at once.
                            Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl, then whisk the mascarpone
                            and vanilla into the whipped cream on medium speed until combined,
                            about 30 seconds.
                        </li>
                        <li>Transfer the whipped cream to a medium bowl.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Whisk the egg yolks and sugar, then fold in the whipped cream.</strong> 
                Combine the egg yolks, sugar, and salt for the mascarpone whipped cream in the stand
                mixer bowl (don't worry about cleaning the bowl!). Beat on medium-high speed until
                light, fluffy, and doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. Scoop half of the whipped cream
                over the egg mixture and fold it in with a rubber spatula. Repeat with the remaining
                whipped cream and fold it in until just combined. At this point, it will be a very
                light and fluffy cream. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Assemble the Earl Grey tiramisu.</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Working with one ladyfinger at a time, dip a ladyfinger in the tea
                            concentrate, and turn to coat. Quickly place it in the pan to arrange
                            a single layer of cookies at the bottom of the pan.
                        </li>
                        <li>Scoop half of the mascarpone whipped cream over the ladyfingers and use 
                            an offset spatula to spread it evenly over the cookies.
                        </li>
                        <li>Repeat the process of soaking the remaining ladyfingers and topping them
                            with the remaining mascarpone whipped cream to make the final 2 layers of
                            the Earl Grey tiramisu.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Chill the Earl Grey tiramisu.</strong> Loosely cover the tiramisu with
                plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve and store.</strong> The tiramisu will keep, tightly covered
                in plastic wrap or in an airtight container, for up to 3 days in the refrigerator.</li>
            </ol>
