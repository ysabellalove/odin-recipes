            <h3>Espresso Mascarpone Frosting</h3>
                <ul>   
                    <li>8 oz. mascarpone cheese, cold</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
                    <li> 2 tsp instant powder espresso</li>
                    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1 cup cold heavy whipping cream</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp cocoa powder <em>for dusting</em></li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, melt the butter and whisk in the espresso
                powder. Transfer to the fridge and cool for about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>In another bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking
                powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk in the cooled espresso butter
                with the granulated sugar until well combined. Whisk in the egg
                and vanilla extract until smooth and well combined.
                Stir the dry ingredients into the wet until just combined.
                I like to do this about half of the dry ingredients at a time.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375F for about 20-30 minutes before baking
                the cookies. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
                Allow the dough to rest while the oven preheats. Using a medium cookie scoop, scoop the cookie dough and place 
                the cookie dough balls onto the lined baking sheet about 3
                inches apart.
            </li>
            <li>Bake at 375F for 10-12 minutes or until the edges of the cookies
                are set and the centers are slightly puffed.
            </li>
            <li>Cool the chewy coffee sugar cookies on the baking sheet for 5 
                minutes. Then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely to
                room temperature. Make the mascarpone frosting while the cookies cool.
            </li>
            <li>On low, whisk the mascarpone cheese until smooth. Once smooth, mix
                in the espresso powder, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar until
                well combined.
            </li>
            <li>Once all the sugar has been added, mix in the heavy cream slowly on
                low speed. Once all the heavy cream has been added, increase the
                mixer speed to medium for about 2-3 minutes or until the frosting
                is light and fluffy.
            </li>
            <li>Top the soft and chewy espresso sugar cookies with 1-2tbsp of
                mascarpone frosting. Use the back of a spoon or an icing spatula to
                smooth the frosting across the top in a circular motion. Dust with
                cocoa powder and ...
            </li>
        </ol>
